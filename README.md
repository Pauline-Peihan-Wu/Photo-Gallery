Want to show some good photos to others? It can be from online or the photos you take.
# Before you begin
- Please take some time to pick some (at least 2) photos/pictures you like, or you take for this project.
- Make sure photos/pictures are approved by the instructor before you use them. **NO INAPPROPRIATE PHOTOS/PICTURES ALLOWED!**
# Objective

# Set-up your files
Make sure you create the following:

Create a link tag for your CSS stylesheet in your html document.

<br/>
<p align="center">
<b>Here's an example of your final product:</b>
<img src="images/img.png">
</p>

# HTML
1. Before the body, at top of the CSS stylesheet tag, create a header containing the title of your gallery using a `title` tag.
2. In the `body` tag, create a header containing your gallery name using `header`tag.
3. Then create a short description of your gallery by using `h2`tag.
4. Now, you can create one `div`tag.
5. Inside this `div`, you can add your photos by creating `img src=""`tag. Then make sure you use the correct `src` link to the image.
6. If the images are too big, you can also size it by add attribute after the link to image. So you will create `style=""`. You can size the width and height.

# CSS
1. In your CSS, you can first size your header
2. Using `header` selector to modify the font size:
- Set it to 50px
3. Using `h2` to modify the description size:
- Set it to x-large
4. Using `img` to add border, margin and padding for the photos:
- Set border to 15px solid black
- Set padding to 5px
- Set margin to 20 px
